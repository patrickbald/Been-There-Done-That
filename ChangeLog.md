Version: 0.4.0

Added Parse functionality to the project in the following ways:
- Added trip information to a Back4App database organized with Trips, Countries, and People
  - Trip contains specific data to the Trip and points to both the Country and the Person
  - Country contains country specific data
  - Person contains person specific data
- Load the feed on mount with Parse Query results
- Allow the user to search specifically for a trip's Title
- Allowed the user to create and save their own trip object to the database in the Add Trip page
